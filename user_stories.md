# PROJECT 2 USER STORIES: CHEERUPS



## Default user story:

As an ANONYMOUS USER, I want to see “cheerups” — short, positive and inspiring quotes to cheer up. 

## Adding detail/Satisfaction conditions:

### As a MEMBER, I want to be able to “LIKE” posts so that I can save them to my “LIKED” collection.  
----I will be satisfied if I can easily save a “cheerup” and view my saved collection

### As a MEMBER, I want to be able to create and submit my own “cheerups” to make other people happy and to cheer myself up when I need it. 
----I will be satisfied if I can easily create and submit my own "cheerups"
