# cheerups!

This app will cheer you up (in progress).

## Description

The Internet can always use more kindness. Sometimes we're our own harshest critic. This corner of the Internet is for positive vibes, only.

## Planning

This project was create to fulfill the requirements for General Assembly's Project 2 in the Software Engineering Immersive Remote program. Cheerup! is my first fullstack web application, built by me from the ground up.

### User Stories

The user stories for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/esin87/cheerup/blob/master/planning/user_stories.md). In short, the default user wants to see "cheerups" -- short, positive, and inspiring quotes that cheer up the reader.

#### Project Management

I used [Trello](trello.com) to break the project into tasks and create to-do lists for each task. This not only allowed me to break larger tasks down into bite-size chunks, but seeing the overall progress as I moved more items into the "done" category was highly motivating.

#### Wire-framing

I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes for each view (an example [here](https://github.com/esin87/cheerup/blob/master/planning/cheerup!%20wireframes/Show%20Me%20a%20Cheerup%20View.png)). These are rough sketches of what I want the finished product to look like.

## Technical Details

#### Backend

Cheerup! runs on a NodeJS/Express server with MongoDB/Mongoose. The file architecture follows the Model-View-Controller schema. The app was deployed using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. Registered users have full CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes.

#### Frontend

Handlebars was used to handle page templates with HTML. A static CSS style file is also included. Vanilla JavaScript was used to create user-interactions on individual pages.

#### Other Technical Details

The code was written in Visual Studio Code. The Prettier, Code Spell Checker, and Bracket Pair Colorizer extensions kept my code organized and functional.
